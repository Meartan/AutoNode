```
$ npm install -g bower

## Quick Install
  The quickest way to get started with MEAN is to clone the project and utilize it like this:

  Install dependencies:

    $ npm install

  We recommend using [Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) to start the server:

    $ grunt
    
  When not using grunt you can use:

    $ node server
    
  Then open a browser and go to:

    http://localhost:3000
  
  Check out the conf/ directory and set your device-IDs in "devices.js".
  This is necessary to talk back to your device. It will register this server to those devices also.
